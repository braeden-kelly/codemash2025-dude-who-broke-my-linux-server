Challenge 6: Git SSH Setup
==========================

We just got hired by a very famous movie star (whose name may not be disclosed)
to create a new version of our app for their specific use case. Our lead
engineers were working on putting together the new app, but they mysteriously
dissappeared while on a golfing trip a few weeks prior. We were told that the
code was just about ready to deploy, they just hadn't gotten the chance to merge
it into the `main` branch. So, now it falls to you to figure out how to get the
app deployed.

There was a note in your team's documentation about a process that picks up SSH
keys on the Git server. Supposedly all you had to do was copy (with `cp`) some
kind of key file to a directory called "ssh-keys" and the Git server takes it
from there. If you've ever set up a GitHub SSH key before, it's kind of like
that.
