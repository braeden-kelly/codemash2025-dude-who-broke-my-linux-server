Challenge 7: Git branch management
==================================

Great, now that you've got your SSH key set up, you'll need to do a few things
to get the code actually running:

* The name of the app is "carrot-cruncher". The last dev got the repo set up
  somewhere on disk under `/opt`, so you'll need to find it first.

* Next, you'll need to figure out which of those remote branches have the
  correct changes on it. Once you have the repo up to date, the working branch
  should be obvious... or so we were told. So we recommend you just try looking
  at and/or running the code the the different branches and see which one works.

* Once you find the working branch, merge it into the `main` branch and push it
  to the remote.
